NHS-R community conference policy

A key element of developing a broad and vibrant community is the annual conference.  This will be delivered in accordance with the following principles.

Delegates access

Free to NHS staff public sector, voluntary sector – subject to available funding.

Academic sector colleagues (50% discounted fees)

Private sector colleagues (100% non-discounted fees)

Speakers

We do not usually pay speakers a speaking fee. Also we are unable to pay speakers travel or subsistence expenses as standard. All presenters are asked in the first instance to seek support from their own employer. If funding to support their contribution is not available from their employer, then a contribution towards the cost of presenting will be considered on a case by case basis. In this scenario, presenters will be asked to provide evidence that support is not available to them, and that some support would be required. This support would be limited in value; dependent upon the number of speakers in the same situation; and is subject to agreement before any costs are incurred.

Where we deem it to be in the wider interest of the NHS-R Community to invite special guest speakers we may consider the issues related to travel expenses, speakers’ fees and entry fees on a case-by-case basis subject to approval from our Conference Organising Group.

Sponsors and exhibitor fees

We are committed to providing free exhibition spaces for funders and partners of the NHS-R Community, including the Health Foundation, AphA, the Strategy Unit and the Improvement Academy. All other individuals and organisations will be asked to pay for exhibitor’s spaces.

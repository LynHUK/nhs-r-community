Advertising policy

Purpose of the Policy

In order to enhance, vary or reduce the cost of NHS R Community activities, the NHS R
Community may provide opportunities for third parties (eg NHS organisations, private sector,
voluntary sector) to advertise content via the NHS-R Community. Such content may be et
gratis or sold for a fee to generate income for the NHS-R Community.

Objectives and Coverage of the Policy

The Advertising Policy outlines the principles and procedures for accepting and granting of
advertising proposals. The Policy is concerned with:

Assessing and managing risk;

Accountability and transparency of decision making;

Financial management and benefits.

What is Advertising?

Advertising implies that a payment has been made to place an ad with specific messaging in
place. The NHS-R Community may sell advertising space to generate additional income
(e.g. website, external and internal poster sites and adverts in magazines).

Principles

All advertising agreements will be in the form of a written agreement and comply with
principles and procedures outlined in this policy which are based on guidance from NHS
England.
It is important that advertising must not damage the good reputation of the NHS or the NHS-
R Community or the value of the NHS/NHS-R brand.
The source of the advertising material must be clearly stated.
The NHS-R Community may offer advertising for free where this is deemed appropriate.
Any advertising should:

be suitable for the target audience

meet public expectations of the NHS/NHS-R brand and support the principles and values underpinning the NHS Identity

not bring the NHS/NHS-R Community into disrepute

not give rise to doubts about the integrity, independence or impartiality of the NHS/NHS-R Community

follow applicable laws and industry codes of practice.

All advertising must be distinct from editorial content so that it is clear to the audience that it is a commercial message. Advertising must not include any endorsement by the NHS or NHS-R Community.

The following categories of advertising are prohibited:

advertising for faith, religion and equivalent systems of belief

advertising for adult products and services

advertising for tobacco products

advertising for weapons and gun clubs

political or lobby group advertising

any advertisements that relate to a controversial health issue or public policy (e.g. foods with a high sugar content).

Advertising the undermines the aims and objectives of the NHS-R Community

Advertising must not be misleading, harmful or offensive. It must not contain anything that is likely to result in physical, mental or moral harm, contain profane language or seek to exploit children’s credulity, loyalty, vulnerability or lack of experience.

Risk Assessment

Each proposal for advertising must be subject to a risk assessment against the above criteria.  If the assessment concludes the risks are unacceptably high or the NHS R Community is receiving minimal value from the proposal, the NHS R Community should discontinue consideration of the advertising proposal at this stage.

Agreements

The NHS R Community’s approved form of Advertising Agreement shall be used in all circumstances wherever possible. However, it is acknowledged there may be circumstances in which the third party may require its own form of agreement to be used. Notwithstanding this, every sponsorship agreement will require a written agreement incorporating conditions of contract which clearly set out.

Transparency

All Advertising Agreements are to be listed in the NHS R Community’s Annual Report

Approval of Agreements

All advertising shall be approved by the Director of the NHS R Community in consultation with members of the TAG.

It is recommended that all parties interested in advertising to or via the NHS-R Community are referred to this policy.

Access to Policy

The Advertising Policy is to be placed on the NHS R Community’s website.

Disclaimer

Acceptance of advertising or sponsorship does not imply any endorsement of the sponsor’s products or services by the NHS-R Community

Conflict of Interest

Board members are required to declare in advance if they have any personal interests, involvement or potential conflict of interest with any potential sponsor. In the event of a potential conflict of interest, member will take no part in the consideration of sponsorship with that particular NHS R Community.

Policy Review

This policy is subject to continuous review and will be reviewed on an annual basis.

# Source code for NHS-R Community website

Following the values and commitment of the NHS-R Community to open source this website has been built in Quarto to be open in its code and further contribution.

Many of the blogs, which go back to the start of NHS-R Community in 2018, were first posted through a WordPress site and so we don't have a record in GitHub for their contributions, however, the author and the date they wrote the blog are in the source code.

New contributions and corrections can be made directly to this repository through a pull request.
Details on how to contribute to an NHS-R Community GitHub repository can be found in the [Statement on Tools](https://tools.nhsrcommunity.com/contribution.html) technical appendix.

## This website is not yet live!

Whilst this site is being built the current url [www.nhsrcommunity.com](www.nhsrcommunity.com) is directed to the WordPress site.
All the blog posts are being saved under the original titles so that when this site is redirected to the [www.nhsrcommunity.com](www.nhsrcommunity.com) url they will be same as the WordPress.

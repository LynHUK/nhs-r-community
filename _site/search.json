    "text": "Advertising policy\nPurpose of the Policy\nIn order to enhance, vary or reduce the cost of NHS R Community activities, the NHS R Community may provide opportunities for third parties (eg NHS organisations, private sector, voluntary sector) to advertise content via the NHS-R Community. Such content may be et gratis or sold for a fee to generate income for the NHS-R Community.\nObjectives and Coverage of the Policy\nThe Advertising Policy outlines the principles and procedures for accepting and granting of advertising proposals. The Policy is concerned with:\nAssessing and managing risk;\nAccountability and transparency of decision making;\nFinancial management and benefits.\nWhat is Advertising?\nAdvertising implies that a payment has been made to place an ad with specific messaging in place. The NHS-R Community may sell advertising space to generate additional income (e.g. website, external and internal poster sites and adverts in magazines).\nPrinciples\nAll advertising agreements will be in the form of a written agreement and comply with principles and procedures outlined in this policy which are based on guidance from NHS England. It is important that advertising must not damage the good reputation of the NHS or the NHS- R Community or the value of the NHS/NHS-R brand. The source of the advertising material must be clearly stated. The NHS-R Community may offer advertising for free where this is deemed appropriate. Any advertising should:\nbe suitable for the target audience\nmeet public expectations of the NHS/NHS-R brand and support the principles and values underpinning the NHS Identity\nnot bring the NHS/NHS-R Community into disrepute\nnot give rise to doubts about the integrity, independence or impartiality of the NHS/NHS-R Community\nfollow applicable laws and industry codes of practice.\nAll advertising must be distinct from editorial content so that it is clear to the audience that it is a commercial message. Advertising must not include any endorsement by the NHS or NHS-R Community.\nThe following categories of advertising are prohibited:\nadvertising for faith, religion and equivalent systems of belief\nadvertising for adult products and services\nadvertising for tobacco products\nadvertising for weapons and gun clubs\npolitical or lobby group advertising\nany advertisements that relate to a controversial health issue or public policy (e.g. foods with a high sugar content).\nAdvertising the undermines the aims and objectives of the NHS-R Community\nAdvertising must not be misleading, harmful or offensive. It must not contain anything that is likely to result in physical, mental or moral harm, contain profane language or seek to exploit children’s credulity, loyalty, vulnerability or lack of experience.\nRisk Assessment\nEach proposal for advertising must be subject to a risk assessment against the above criteria.  If the assessment concludes the risks are unacceptably high or the NHS R Community is receiving minimal value from the proposal, the NHS R Community should discontinue consideration of the advertising proposal at this stage.\nAgreements\nThe NHS R Community’s approved form of Advertising Agreement shall be used in all circumstances wherever possible. However, it is acknowledged there may be circumstances in which the third party may require its own form of agreement to be used. Notwithstanding this, every sponsorship agreement will require a written agreement incorporating conditions of contract which clearly set out.\nTransparency\nAll Advertising Agreements are to be listed in the NHS R Community’s Annual Report\nApproval of Agreements\nAll advertising shall be approved by the Director of the NHS R Community in consultation with members of the TAG.\nIt is recommended that all parties interested in advertising to or via the NHS-R Community are referred to this policy.\nAccess to Policy\nThe Advertising Policy is to be placed on the NHS R Community’s website.\nDisclaimer\nAcceptance of advertising or sponsorship does not imply any endorsement of the sponsor’s products or services by the NHS-R Community\nConflict of Interest\nBoard members are required to declare in advance if they have any personal interests, involvement or potential conflict of interest with any potential sponsor. In the event of a potential conflict of interest, member will take no part in the consideration of sponsorship with that particular NHS R Community.\nPolicy Review\nThis policy is subject to continuous review and will be reviewed on an annual basis.\nDate agreed: 9th February 2021\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Out of interest, I wanted to find out how much the ticket cost per day, taking into account I don’t use it on weekends or my paid holidays. I started my workings out initially in Excel but got as far as typing the formula =WORKDAYS() before I realised it was going to take some working out and perhaps I should give it a go in R as a function…\nChris Beeley had recently shown me functions in R and I was surprised how familiar they were as I’ve seen them on Stack Overflow (usually skimmed over those) and they are similar to functions in SQL which I’ve used (not written) where you feed in parameters.\nWhen I write code I try to work out how each part works and build it up but writing a function requires running the whole thing and then checking the result, the objects that are created in the function do not materialise so are never available to check. Not having objects building up in the environment console is one of the benefits of using a function, that and not repeating scripts which then ALL need updating if something changes."

    "section": "Going through each line:",
    "text": "Going through each line:\nTo make sure each part within the function works it’s best to write it in another script or move the bit betweeen the curly brackets {}.\nFirstly, the startDate is self explanatory but within the function I’ve set the endDate to be dependent upon the startDate and be automatically 1 year later.\nOriginally when I was trying to find the “year after” a date I found some documentation about {lubridate}’s function dyear():\nbut this gives an exact year after a given date and doesn’t take into account leap years. I only remember this because 2020 will be a leap year so the end date I got was a day out!\nInstead, Chris Beeley suggested the following:\nNext, the code builds a sequence of days. I got this idea of building up the days from the blogs on getting days between two dates but it has also come in use when plotting over time in things like SPCs when some of the time periods are not in the dataset but would make sense appearing as 0 count.\nAll of these return values so trying to open them from the Global Environment won’t do anything. It is possible view the first parts of the values but also typing:\n\n\n Date[1:367], format: \"2019-07-11\" \"2019-07-12\" \"2019-07-13\" \"2019-07-14\" \"2019-07-15\" ...\n\n\n        Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max. \n\"2019-07-11\" \"2019-10-10\" \"2020-01-10\" \"2020-01-10\" \"2020-04-10\" \"2020-07-11\" \n\n\nTo find out what a function does type ?str or?summary in the console. The help file will then appear in the bottom right Help screen.\nNext I worked out working_days. I got the idea from a blog which said to use length and which:\nNote that the value appears as 262L which is a count of a logical vector. Typing ?logical into the Console gives this in the Help:\nLogical vectors are coerced to integer vectors in contexts where a numerical value is required, with TRUE being mapped to 1L, FALSE to 0L and NA to NA_integer._\nI was familiar with length(), it does a count essentially of factors or vectors (type ?length into the Console for information) but which() wasn’t something I knew about. Chris Beeley explained what which does with the following example:\n\n\n [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\n\n[1] 2 4 5 6 9\n\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThen Chris Beeley suggested just using sum instead of length(which()) which counts a logical vector:\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nIt seems this has been discussed on Stack Overflow before: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2190756/how-to-count-true-values-in-a-logical-vector\nIt’s worthy of note that using sum will also count NAs so the example on Stack overflow suggest adding:\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nThis won’t affect the objects created in this blog as there were no NAs in them but it’s just something that could cause a problem if used in a different context.\nI then wanted to take into account bank/public holidays as I wouldn’t use the ticket on those days so I used the function holidayLONDON( from the package {timeDate}:\n\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nI used lubridate::year because the package {timeDate} uses a parameter called year so the code would read year = year(startDate) which is confusing to me let alone the function!\nAgain, I counted the vectors using length(). This is a crude way of getting bank/public holidays as it is looking at a calendar year and not a period (July to July in this case).\nI did look at a package called {bizdays} but whilst that seemed to be good for building a calendar I couldn’t work out how to make it work so I just stuck with the {timeDate} package. I think as I get more confident in R it might be something I could look into the actual code for because all packages are open source and available to view through CRAN or GitHub.\nBack to the function…\nI then added - EmployHoliday so I could reduce the days by my paid holidays and - wfh to take into account days I’ve worked from home and therefore not travelled into work.\nThe next part of the code takes the entered Cost and divides by the Working_days, printing the output to the screen:\nper_day &lt;- Cost/working_days\nprint(per_day)\nAnd so the answer to the cost per day is printed in the Console:\n\n\n[1] 2.707965"
